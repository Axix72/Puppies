<h1>History of anime</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6"><p>Japanese animation began in the early 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States and Russia. A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin, an undated and private work by an unknown creator. In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear. Animators such as Ōten Shimokawa and Seitarou Kitayama produced numerous works, with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi's Namakura Gatana, a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat. The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake resulted in widespread destruction to Japan's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse, destroying most of these early works.</p></div>

<h1>Top anime of the season</h1>

<p>Anime usually lasts for a few several episodes, (unlike series such as <a href="https://www.google.es/?gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=33W1UpjeHKmCyQOG7oD4DA#q=dragon+ball+z">Dragon Ball Z</a> and <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokemon</a>), here's the summer 2017 version!</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Kakegurui</strong><br>
  Hyakkaou Private Academy. An institution for the privileged with a very peculiar curriculum. You see, when you're the sons and daughters of the wealthiest of the wealthy, it's not athletic prowess or book smarts that keep you ahead. It's reading your opponent, the art of the deal. What better way to hone those skills than with a rigorous curriculum of gambling? At Hyakkaou Private Academy, the winners live like kings, and the losers are put through the wringer. But when Yumeko Jabami enrolls, she's gonna teach these kids what a high roller really looks like!</br><br><img style="width: 60%;" src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/manga/1/142175l.jpg"></br></p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Koi to Uso</strong><br>
  Lies are forbidden and love is doubly forbidden. In the near future, when young people in Japan turn sixteen, they are assigned a marriage partner by the government. People don't have to go through the trouble of looking for someone, and everyone accepts that the country will find a compatible partner to make them happy. Yukari Nejima is fifteen years old. He lives in a small corner of the country, and just can't seem to get ahead in life. Both academically and athletically he's below average. But within him, he hides a heart burning with passion! In this world in which love is forbidden, what will happen to him when he falls in love?</br><br><img  style="width: 60%;" src="http://horriblesubs.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/koitouso.jpg"></br></p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Violet Evergarden</strong><br> 
  Auto Memories Doll. It's been quite a while since that name caused a fuss. Originally invented by Professor Orland solely for his beloved wife, Auto Memories Dolls eventually spread out into the world, and a machine that allows people to rent out the dolls was also created. "I will run as fast as I can to wherever my customer desires. I am the Auto Memories Doll, Violet Evergarden."
A girl who almost appears to have popped out of a fairy tale with her blonde hair and blue eyes said this with her inorganic beauty and sweet voice.</br><br><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://www.koi-nya.net/img/subidos_posts/2016/05/Violet-Evergarden-Anime.png"></br></p></div>
</div>




<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Hajimete no Gal</strong><br>Spring. The "season of love" has arrived and it seems that finding himself a girlfriend was harder than Junichi believed. To break the status quo, Junichi's friends have forced him into confessing to the gal, Yame Yukana. However, things do not go quite as he expected. A series of "firsts" begins!</br><br><img style="width: 100%;" src="http://communaute.icotaku.com/uploads/news/news_4981/news_SjkeZDcFdURJUD3.png"></br></p>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Katsugeki/Touken Ranbu</strong><br>The year is 1863 as the tumultuous samurai era is coming to an end, Japan is split between the pro-shogunate and anti-shogunate factions. The fate of the world is threatened as an army of historical revisionists are sent from the future to alter the course of history. In order to bring these forces down and protect the real history, two sword warriors, spirits who are swords brought to life by Saniwa (sage), rush to Edo. The polite and thoughtful Horikawa Kunihiro and the short tempered yet skillful Izuminokami Kanesada, who served the same master, confront the invading army along with a lively gang of other warriors including Mutsunokami Yoshiyuki, Yagen Toushirou, Tombokiri, and Tsurumaru Kuninaga.
As the fate of history lies in these hero's hands, what meets the blade is yet to be uncovered...</br><br><img style="width: 70%;" src="http://loadanimehd.com/images/Katsugeki-Touken-Ranbu.jpg"></br></p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><p><strong>Gamers!</strong><br>This is a story that revolves around certain students and one hobby. Amano Keita is our lonely protagonist who has a passion for gaming and is friends with Uehara Tasuku, who is secretly a fellow gamer and is someone who believes his life is perfect. We also have Karen Tendou, the club president of the video games club and Chiaki Hoshinomori, who constantly bickers with Keita.
